### git basics
``` 

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate on software projects. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the basics:

1. ## Repositories

A Git repository is a directory that tracks all the changes made to files within it. There are two types:

(a) Local Repository: Stored on your machine.

(b) Remote Repository: Stored on a server like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

2. ## Basic command

1. git init: Initializes a new Git repository.

2. git clone [url]: Copies an existing repository from a remote server to your local machine.

3. git status: Shows the current status of your repository, including untracked files, changes to be committed, and files not staged for commit.

4. git add [file]: Stages a file (adds it to the "staging area") to be included in the next commit.

5. git commit -m "message": Commits your staged changes with a message describing what has been done.

6. git pull: Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to your local branch.

7. git push: Sends your committed changes to the remote repository.

8. git branch: Lists branches or creates a new branch.

9. git checkout -b [branch-name]: Switches to a different branch.

10. git merge [branch-name]: Merges changes from another branch into the current branch.


```
### git pull vs git fetch
```

The primary difference between git pull and git fetch lies in what they do with the changes they retrieve from a remote repository.


* git fetch
What it does: Downloads new data (commits, branches, tags, etc.) from the remote repository to your local machine but does not update your working directory or merge changes.


Use case: This is useful when you want to see what changes are available on the remote without affecting your local work. You can then review the changes and decide when/how to integrate them (e.g., by using git merge or git rebase).


* git pull


What it does: Downloads new data from the remote repository and automatically merges the changes into your current branch. It's essentially a combination of git fetch followed by git merge.


Use case: This is useful when you want to immediately integrate the latest changes from the remote into your current branch. However, this can lead to merge conflicts if there are changes in the remote branch that conflict with your local changes.


* Key Difference:


git fetch gives you a chance to inspect changes before applying them.

git pull automatically updates your working directory and merges the fetched changes.


If you prefer more control over how changes are incorporated into your branch, git fetch might be a safer choice. If you want to quickly update your branch, git pull is more convenient.
